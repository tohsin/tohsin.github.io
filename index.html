    Hey there! (OBI wan Kenobi):wave:
    <br />
    I am currently interested in SLAM/ Visual SLAM algorithms and Reinforcement learning 
    for planning and control in Robotics, I hope to do more work on these in the future and maybe
    one day find a research topic that will fuse both.
    <br />
    Fields of Interests:
    <br />
    Robotics, Slam & Visual Slam , Reinfrocement Learning, Artificial intellgence, Machine learning, optimization, motion planning, Control and  Genetic Algorithms

Accepting my fate early on was a hard thing, 
as a scientist in my short life I would never 
be able to try and solve problems in as many domains as I would love to but 
hopefully in the grand search to solve intelligence I would have contributed to everything else.

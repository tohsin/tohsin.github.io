<h2>ALAC : Constrained Model-Free Reinforcement Learning with Finite-Time Stability Guarantee</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Abstract: Model-based control methods have achieved impressive performance 
on a large variety robotic tasks over the past few decades. Then recently,
due to eliminating the difficulty of modeling and parameter-tuning, 
model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods perform better under some complex scenarios.
However, the lack of stability guarantee, which affects the interpretability of the contorl system,
remains a significant difference in contrast to traditional methods. 
Therefore, we propose a Lyapunov-based actor-critic method that guarantees the stability 
of control system. Interestingly, we introduce the data-driven stability condition that meets 
the demand of finite-time stability convergence. Furthermore, the Lyapunov critic function is
conducted by a constrained neural network, thus making some necessary conditions satisfied naturally. 
Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves lower cost and faster convergence rate
compared with previous studies.</p>

<td align="left"><p>SpaceRobotEnv is an open-sourced environment for trajectory planning of free-floating space robots.
Different from the traditional robot, the free-floating space robot is a dynamic coupling
system because of the non-actuated base.
Therefore, model-based trajectory planning methods encounter many difficulties in modeling 
and computing.

<h2>LOUISE -A Medical CHATBOT </h2>

<td align="left"><p>A Medical Chatbot designed to suggest emergency diagnosis from symptoms communicated by users but unlike other chatbots, 
we show a technique that avoids large datasets of intents required to train similar bots.
The Chatbot has a separate SVC model trained to categorize health problems based on symptoms and we have a separate Transformer 
model to detect Symptoms as intents and using several similarity algorithms, map the right symptoms.
Splitting the backend like this avoids hours of writing a lot of intents to map symptoms in phrases to diagnosis</p>

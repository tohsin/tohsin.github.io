<td align="left"><p>My implimentation of probabilistic robotics algorithms for localisationa and SLAM like Prticle Filter, 
Kalman Filter, EKF, and main implimentation of graph SLAM in a  2d pygame simulator </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Backend optimises a pose graph of Gauss Netwon for optimisation using the schur trick</p>
</li>
<li><p>Frontend Impliments an Iterative closest point for the simulated point cloud and user has to guid 
robot to start point for loop closure</p>

<h2>Visual Slam and Visual Slam Python</h2>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="vslam.png" alt="alt text" width="200px" height="130px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>Implimentaion of several concepts in visual Slam like Visual Odometry, optical flow, bundle adjustment, pose graph,
loop closure, Siding window and dense reconstruction using Gauss Newton or g2o for optimisation. 
Visual slam Python is meant to serve as python repo to prototype Visual slam concepts using python  wrappers for
g2o, pangolin etc.<br /></p>

<h2>Tomato harvesting Soft Robotic arm (Research Assistant)</h2>
<p>Joined a team of 3 with a graduate student to design and impliment an almost cost effective soft robotic arm to be used for 
harvesting Tomatos in a farm.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using a vaccum pump, Cassava and rubber as the mechanism to grab Tomatos and harvest them</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trained a YOLO algorithms to identify types of tamatoes as well as asses state of fruit (Ripe/ Unripe) and deploy a version on raspberry pI</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simulated manipulator forward and inverse kinematic motions using python robotics toolbox.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>LOUISE -A Medical CHATBOT </h2>
<p>Medical Cahtbot designed to suggest emergency suggestions and solutions by avoiding large datasets of intents
required to train similar bots. Chat bot has a sperate SVC model trained to categorise halth problems  based on
symptoms and a seperate Transformer model to detect Symptoms as intents and using several simlarity algoritms, map
the right symptoms. Spliting the backend like this avoids hourse of writing a lot of intents to map symptoms in phrases to diagnosis</p>

<h2>Electronic Car Ignition using Face Recongnition </h2>
<p>Development of a portable device to work with cars for car owners to start engines using face recognition,
application comes with a GUI and LCD and is developed to run optimally on a raspberry pi with motors 
attached to simulate car engine starting.</p>

<h2>IOT Remote Farm monitoring</h2>
<p>Development of an IOT solution for farmers to monitor some properties of their farms remotely using a colllection of 
sensors suite with real time connection to a web API that works with an IOS MObile application and also inludes and
automatic sprikler if soil humidity drops to a certain threshold.</p>
<h2>Car Monitoring OBD2-Mobile</h2>
<p>A portable Device working wtih an OBD device connected to cars providing realtime data and in some cases diagnosis 
to users remotely to theoir mobile devices. The OBD2 rmotley connects to a RAspberry Pi that then publishes 
information to user website or mobile device.</p>
<h2>Double Transfer learning for Covid Prediction on Mobile Devices</h2>
<p>We show a proof of double transfer learning, The neural Net was first trained on large dataset of X-rays on pneumoia 
so neural net learns structure of Xray images and the finally trained on Covid Xray data set.
Due to compatibility and optimsation Mobile net was the prettrained model to allow easy qunatisation to deploy on a 
mobile device with tensor flow Localisation_and_Slam_algorithms_implimentation</p>
<h2>Remote Repogrammable Robotic Arm (Final Year Project)</h2>
<p>Development of a remote solution to programming robot arms.A mobile application that remotely connects to the
robotic arm and offers two modes one two dirretly actuate the arm and one to programd ans save a sequence of
tasks so one robot can be adapted and switched to diffrent task easily.</p>
<h2>Robot Receptionist Concept Design ( Group project)</h2>
<p>Concept design for robot receptionist during the Covid 19 period to provide tour for users visiting the
mechaincal Engineering building. We explore CAD design of the robot, use of active Rfid for localisation,
prerecorded audio for conversations and a langauge model for intent detection</p>

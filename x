Hey there! (Obi Wan Kenobi Voice)

My Drive:
Accepting my fate early on was a hard thing, 
as a scientist in my short life I would never 
be able to try and solve problems in as many domains as I would love to but 
hopefully in the grand search to solve intelligence I would have contributed to everything else.
